Android Key Attestation Library
===================================

This library uses the [Bouncy Castle ASN.1][1] parser to extract information
from an Android attestation data structure to verify that a key pair has been
generated in a hardware-protected environment of an Android device. It is
sample code only, and not intended for production use.

This repository contains a [server](src/main/java/com/android/example/)
sample code that shows how to validate an Android attestation certificate chain
outside the Android framework. This is the recommended best practice, since if
the Android device is rooted or otherwise compromised, on-device validation of
the attestation may be inaccurate.

The entry point into the
[library itself](src/main/java/com/google/android/attestation/)
is `com.google.android.attestation.ParsedAttestationRecord.createParsedAttestationRecord`.
